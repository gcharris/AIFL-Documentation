# Quick Start

Get up and running with AIFL in just a few minutes with this quick start guide.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have completed the [Installation](installation.md) process before proceeding.

## Running Your First AIFL Script

1. Open the `main.py` file in your project directory.

2. Review the existing code, which demonstrates basic AIFL functionality:
   - Data retrieval and processing
   - Data encryption using Fernet symmetric encryption
   - Model training and evaluation

3. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Observe the output, which will include:
   - A test of the data encryption functionality
   - An AIFL-processed explanation of the AIFL concept and symbols used

## Understanding the Output

The output will provide both concise symbol representations and detailed explanations for each AIFL symbol used in the process. This includes:

- ΔΔ1 (Retrieve Data)
- ΔΙ5 (Normalize Data)
- ΔΖ3 (Transform Data)
- ΔΕ1 (Encrypt Data)
- ΔΘ5α (Supervised Learning)
- ΔΜ1 (Train Model)
- ΔΝ2 (Model Evaluation)

## Next Steps

- Explore the [Basic Usage](basic-usage.md) guide to learn more about AIFL symbols and syntax.
- Review the [Core Concepts](../Core_Concepts/Introduction.md) for a deeper understanding of AIFL.
- Experiment with modifying the `main.py` script to use different AIFL symbols and processes.
