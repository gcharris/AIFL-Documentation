## Overview

AIFL-Documentation aims to establish a **standardized language and protocols** enabling AI agents to communicate effectively. This facilitates coordinated actions, data sharing, and interoperability across various AI systems, enhancing their collaborative capabilities.

## Features

- **AIFL Parser and Executor**: Parses and executes AIFL expressions using a standardized set of symbols and grammar.
- **Standardized Symbols and Grammar**: Utilizes a consistent set of symbols and grammar rules defined in the [SYMBOLS.md](docs/SYMBOLS.md) and [GRAMMAR.md](docs/GRAMMAR.md) files.
- **Communication Protocols**: Defines protocols for AI agent communication, enabling seamless interaction between different AI systems.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the language and protocols to accommodate new requirements and AI functionalities.
- **Security Measures**: Implements data encryption and security protocols to ensure safe communication and data handling between AI agents.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and references for symbols, grammar, communication protocols, and project roadmap.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements mechanisms for managing and recovering from communication errors and failures.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Provides tools for tracking and analyzing agent interactions and system performance.

---

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code files, including the parser (`aifl_parser.py`), executor (`aifl_executor.py`), and other core components.
- **`tests/`**: Includes all test files to ensure the correctness and reliability of the codebase.
- **`docs/`**: Contains documentation files, such as symbols definitions, grammar rules, communication protocols, and the project roadmap.
- **`assets/`**: Holds images and other asset files used in documentation or the project.

## Installation

To get started with **AIFL-Documentation**, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gcharris/AIFL-Documentation.git
cd AIFL-Documentation
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have **Python 3.7** or higher installed. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

If your project uses environment variables (e.g., for API keys), set them up accordingly. **Do not include your actual API key in any files or commit it to version control.**

For Unix-based systems:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

For Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

**Note**: Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your actual API key when running the commands.

---

## Usage

You can use the AIFL executor to parse and execute AIFL expressions. Here's an example:

```python
from src.aifl_executor import AIFLExecutor

executor = AIFLExecutor()
expression = "ΔΕ1(Data: 'SensitiveInfo', EncryptionType: 'AES256') ∧ ΔΙ5 ⇒ ΔΖ3"
result = executor.execute(expression)
print(result)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Executed operation: ⇒
  Left: Executed operation: ∧
    Left: Executed function: ΔΕ1(Data: SensitiveInfo, EncryptionType: AES256)
    Right: Executed symbol: ΔΙ5
  Right: Executed symbol: ΔΖ3
```

## Communication Protocols

To enable AI agents to communicate seamlessly, we've defined standardized communication protocols documented in [PROTOCOLS.md](docs/PROTOCOLS.md).

- **Message Format**: JSON-based messages that include sender, receiver, message type, and content.
- **Transport Layer**: Uses HTTP with RESTful APIs for communication between agents.
- **Security**: Communications are secured using TLS encryption and include authentication mechanisms.

For detailed information, refer to the [Communication Protocols Documentation](docs/PROTOCOLS.md).

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available to guide you through the various components and functionalities of AIFL-Documentation:

- **Symbols Definition**: See [SYMBOLS.md](docs/SYMBOLS.md) for a comprehensive list of symbols and their meanings.
- **Grammar Rules**: Refer to [GRAMMAR.md](docs/GRAMMAR.md) for detailed grammar rules used in parsing AIFL expressions.
- **Communication Protocols**: Explore [PROTOCOLS.md](docs/PROTOCOLS.md) for detailed communication standards and practices.
- **Project Roadmap**: Check [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for upcoming milestones and development plans.
