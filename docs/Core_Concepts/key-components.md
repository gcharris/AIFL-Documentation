# AIFL Key Components

## Core System Components

### 1. AIFL Parser
The AIFL Parser is responsible for interpreting and validating AIFL messages, ensuring they conform to the specified syntax and grammar rules.

#### Key Features
- EBNF-based grammar parsing
- Symbol validation and resolution
- Syntax tree generation
- Error detection and reporting
- Support for extensible grammar rules

#### Implementation Highlights
```python
# Example parser usage
message = "ΜΑΝ1(Agents: [A1, A2], Topic: 'ResourceAllocation')"
parsed_message = parser.parse(message)
```

### 2. AIFL Executor
The Executor component processes validated AIFL messages and manages their execution within the system.

#### Core Capabilities
- Message execution pipeline
- State management
- Asynchronous operation support
- Error handling and recovery
- Execution context management

#### Example Flow
```python
# Basic execution pattern
async def process_message(message):
    """
    Main message processing loop
    - Handles message delivery
    - Updates conversation state
    - Manages retries
    """
```

### 3. Integration Framework
The Integration Framework enables seamless communication with various AI platforms through standardized interfaces.

#### Platform Support
- Base integration interface
- Platform-specific adapters
- Rate limiting mechanisms
- Error mapping
- State synchronization

#### Integration Pattern
```python
class BaseAIIntegration:
    async def send_message(self, aifl_message: str, 
                          conversation_id: str, 
                          context: Optional[Dict] = None) -> str:
        """Base message sending interface"""
```

### 4. Message Router
The Message Router directs AIFL messages between agents and components within the system.

#### Features
- Dynamic routing
- Load balancing
- Priority handling
- Delivery confirmation
- Retry logic

#### Routing Logic
```python
async def route_message(self, conversation_id: str, 
                       message_id: str, 
                       message_data: Dict) -> bool:
    """Routes messages to appropriate agents"""
```
